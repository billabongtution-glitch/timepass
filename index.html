  <h1>ðŸ’™ Vybhoohith & Kruthika ðŸ’™</h1>
  <p>
    Ninth grade. Two classrooms. 9A and 9B.<br>
    Vybhoohith, just 13, sat in 9B, quietly watching the girl in 9Aâ€”Kruthika.<br>
    He never said hi. Never spoke a word. But in his heart, she was everything.
  </p>
  <div class="heart">ðŸ’“</div>
  <p>
    Every time she walked by, his world paused. Her smile, her voice, even from a distance, felt like sunshine.<br>
    He didnâ€™t know how to say it. So he wrote this page, hoping one day she might read it and understand.<br>
    That even silence can carry love.
  </p>
