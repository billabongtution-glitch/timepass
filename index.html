  <h1>Kruthika 🌸</h1>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>✨ More Than Just a Name</h2>
    <p>She’s not just a girl in class. She’s the reason the day feels brighter, the reason I try harder, the reason I smile when no one’s looking.</p>
    <p class="quote">"She doesn’t know it, but she’s the center of my little universe."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>🧑‍🎓 And I’m Vybhoohith</h2>
    <p>13 years old, 9th grade, and quietly in love. I write code, play games, and dream of a moment where I can finally tell her how I feel.</p>
    <p class="quote">"I’m not brave yet... but every heartbeat whispers her name."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>💬 What She Means to Me</h2>
    <p>She’s the calm in my chaos. The reason I rewrite my notes, fix my hair, and pretend I’m not staring. She’s the story I’m scared to tell, but desperate to live.</p>
    <p class="quote">"If she ever read this, I hope she’d smile... and maybe understand."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>💖 The Unspoken Truth</h2>
    <p>I love her. Deeply. Silently. And maybe foolishly. But it’s real. Every glance, every moment, every word she says—it stays with me longer than it should.</p>
    <p class="quote">"I don’t need her to love me back. I just need her to know she’s loved."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="footer">
    This page isn’t about me. It’s about her. Kruthika—if you ever find this, know that you’ve already changed someone’s world.
